# COCKTAIL LIST
    
## Contributers: 
    Andrew Hinrichs    

## Description:
    Previously a working random cocktail generator that I am refactoring. I hope to create an interactive database of cocktails with recipes, pictures, and instructions where people can save different cocktails to their favorites in thier profiles. This will also bring back the random drink gen for people who want to try somthing new and allow people to create new drinks of their own that can be shared. 

        currently messing with different templates and working on initial refactor as well as db/server implimentation
